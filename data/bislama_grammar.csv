This can also be further reduced in everyday pronunciation to just bl- when the following word begins with a vowel rather than a consonant. Thus, blong olgeta 'theirs' will often be pronounced in casual speech as bl-olgeta. Also, given that hem alternates in pronunciation with em, blong hem 'his, hers, its' often appears as either blo-hem, or even bl-em. Such shortened pronunciations, however, are seldom reflected in the written form of the language. “"
