Postnominal ia is generally considered to be a focus or emphatic marker, but Smith (2002:155-156) observes that in his data, it most often has an anaphoric function. It can also be used to direct the hearer’s attention to a referent in the environment.” The confidence of Smith & Siegel in coding for a postnominal demonstrative is ‘intermediate’, which I have reflected here in a question mark coding."
